# CNC-AutoLeveling
A tool for CNC auto-leveling 

The [AutoLeveller](https://www.autoleveller.co.uk/) is a great tool for auto-leveling CNC jobs. However, it requires the machine to support G30/G31 z-probe command to generate the mesh/probe file.
To enable gerating the probe file for those machines that don't have these probe command implemented, this repo introduces a solution using the serial port and GPIO on a Raspberry PI.
